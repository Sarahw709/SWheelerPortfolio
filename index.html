      <h2>About me</h2>
       <p>
        My name is Sarah Wheeler, and I am a Junior-year transfer student at San Jose State University. I transferred from Las Positas College, and I have lived in the Bay Area for my entire life. Some hobbies that I indulge in are spending time with friends, seeing live music, being outside, and drawing. Since I was a young child, I have always held a strong passion for all types of art forms, whether it was painting, drawing, coloring, etc. While in high school, I started taking art seriously, mainly focusing on traditional art mediums like colored pencil and paint. In my senior year of high school I enrolled in an AP Art course, where I earned a 5 on my portfolio. When entering college, I transitioned into digital mediums like Adobe platforms and ProCreate. While traditional art may sometimes be confined to a physical space, the boundless ability that digital platforms have to reach unlimited audiences intrigued me. Although I still hold a love for traditional mediums, I realized I want to pursue digital media and am excited to expand my knowledge and creativity. </p>
       <p>
        The reason I have a  love for art is because it is so dynamic and ever-changing. It can be anything I want it to be, and is a way of expressing myself. As somebody who often struggles writing on paper, art is my way of conveying my emotions and thoughts to viewers with imagery rather than words. When creating my own art, I usually make pieces personal to myself, whether it is an emotion I’m feeling  or something I’m curious to explore. As a child, my inspiration to create art came from both my surroundings and my favorite movies.  I would obtain blank sheets of paper, and try my best to replicate cartoons and images found in my room. Since most of my current art focuses on realism, I find inspiration from people, places and things that I love in my life.  In my most recent projects as well as in my portfolio, I have experimented more with digital illustration and animation. This has allowed me to explore themes such as memory and identity, and create profound narratives that evoke a sense of curiosity or introspection. </p>
        <p>Although I currently focus on digital art mediums rather than traditional, the journey to doing so was not easy. Transitioning into a completely different platform was very intimidating and presented me with many challenges. Venturing far out of my comfort zone to relearn everything I knew about art was difficult for me, but I pushed forward and got more comfortable and confident in myself over time. I now love creating on Adobe, whether it is Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, or Premiere Pro, and I am so excited to continue and grow throughout my profession. In the future, my goal is to pursue a career in a creative digital environment, such as interactive media, design, illustration, animation, creative art director, or anywhere else where I can flourish and collaborate with others who share the same passion and ideas as me. This program is the next phase of my journey, and it will allow me to grow my skills and experience in order to turn my career goals into a reality. I am excited about the chance to contribute my creativity to this community, and immerse myself further into this discipline of endless possibilities and opportunity.

     <br>
    For this Art 74 assignment, It was required to create an Adobe Illustrator vector drawing out of any still life object. I chose a perfume bottle in my own room that I use frequently, so this was an item that I correlate myself personally with. I used the Illustrator pen tool to create many small vector points in order to produce the rough edges and achieve the effect of realism. I was then instructed to convert the vector drawing into a sticker cutout, and use Adobe Photoshop to make it appear like a real sticker. I experimented around with Photoshop tools until I was satisfied with my end result, and it seemed to look like a realistic sticker on my own computer.

     <br>
      For this Art 74 assignment, the prompt was to experiment with Adobe Photoshop and create a composition made up of different images taken from Pinterest. For my project, I wanted to create the feeling of a dreamlike theme, that was slightly uneasy but also calming and familiar at the same time. The colors of it also follow the same dreamy vibe, its main color being the soft/dark purple, with some vivid colors thrown in to imitate how a dream can feel. This project made it extremely fun to play around with the image layers, and manipulate the appearance of the piece until I was satisfied with the end result. I also become more familiar with utilizing layer masks, and cutting out pieces of images to use them for something else.

        For this Art 74 assignment, the goal was to become familiar with Adobe After Effects by creating a short looping clip. The theme was to make a piece inspired by a famous art movement, so I chose the Suprematism movement. I stuck with the abstract visuals that encapsulate that theme, and added in little figurines made during that movement using Photoshop. I also stuck with a more neutral color palette, which I felt also added to the theme. This was the first time I had ever used After Effects or any kind of animation techniques, so it was intimidating at first. After various experimentation and trial and error, I came up with this short looping video that brought me out of my comfort zone.

     <br>
       This was an Art 74 assignment that prompted me to create a simple robot design using coding in p5. I chose to create a robot inspired off of a cat design, because I have a strong personal love for cats. I wanted the design to be very clean and minimalist, which I believe I successfully conveyed. This was my first assignment that required coding techniques, so this was a new area for me. After creating an initial design in Adobe Illustrator and then replicating it using coding in p5, this assignment taught me how to create a design in code.

     <br>
      This Art 74 Assignment was meant to familiarize us more with coding. The prompt was to manually code a website blog about any subject on CodePen. I chose to create a tourist's guide of Porto, Portugal, because it is one of my favorite places and it is very special to me. I also stuck with a color scheme that I felt matched the vibe of Porto. This was my second time using coding techniques, and my first time coding my own website from scratch. Although it took me quite a while to learn the platform of CodePen, I created this simple yet clean website, and familiarized myself further in this subject.

     <br>
         For this final project in Art 74, the prompt was to create a short video animation that mimicked a self-playing video game on Adobe After Effects. For my assignment, I wanted to create a very cute and comical cartoon video game. To create the visual design, I utilized Adobe Illustrator's pen tool to make a cute yet simple design. I then exported the design to After Effects, where I animated the image frame by frame. The game consists of two cats fishing for fish on a lake, and the goal is to catch 3 fish that are swimming by. This was one of my first times animating on After Effects, so this was fun yet intimidating to experiment and play around with. Although it took me a long amount of time to animate, and there was much trial and error, I am satisfied and proud of the end result.

     <br>
       "Into the Wilderness" is a digital video piece for Art 75 that depicts a recent camping trip I went on. Its purpose is to document the small beauties of nature, and to shed light on small details that may not be noticed to the naked eye, while keeping an orangey autumn aesthetic. I also wanted to capture all types of organic movement in nature, which can be seen in the clips. This assignment was one of the first times I had experimented with real video editing techniques, so it was relatively new. I spent many days exploring various video, sound, and color effects, which led me to this final product. I am very proud of this piece, and how much it brought me out of my own comfort zone.

     <b>Project Description:</b>
     <br>
       My final piece for Art 75, titled “Fragmented Memories” encapsulates me going through the motions of my everyday life, while piecing together memories from my childhood that I have flashbacks of throughout my day. Throughout the video, we see the childhood memories slowly become less and less blurred and distorted, signifying the memories becoming clearer to me as I remember. I filmed videos from an old TV, part of the reason being I wanted viewers to feel like they were watching from an old TV just like I was. I then recorded moments from my current daily life, and used clips that ‘triggered’ these old memories and reminded me of the childhood clips being presented. To create the effect of the memories being distorted and foggy, I used various different Premiere Pro audio and visual effects, such as distorted echos and lens distortion. As the video progressed, I allowed the distortions to become less and less effective, to give the idea that the memories are slowly starting to become more clear to me. This leads up to the final ending scene, where I dream about a childhood memory that is finally vivid in my imagination. I am extremely proud of this piece I produced in the end, as it challenged me to further explore video editing techniques.

     <b>Project Description:</b>
     <br>
  This piece for Art 3 is meant to serve as a deliberation of what it means to yearn for something that is beyond physical reach, but rather a memory of the past. It illustrates a television screen in the center of the image, containing a VHS video of a little girl playing surrounded by bright and vivid colors. Outside of the television, two hands are reached out from a darker first-person view, barely grasping a television remote and attempting to touch the screen. At the bottom of the image, covered in shadow, it can be observed that the hands are locked in handcuffs. The warm colors in the VHS video are meant to make viewers feel a nostalgic comfort, while the dark shadows surrounding the television are meant to invoke dreariness or dullness.I chose digital media(ProCreate) as my material because I wanted this piece to be a physical art work rather than conceptual, and this is a medium I am familiar and comfortable with.  By illustrating both my younger self and my current self in the image, I wanted it to not only feel personal to myself but to the viewers as well.

     <b>Project Description:</b>
     <br>
     “Frozen in Time” is a conceptual spatial art installation piece for Art 3 depicting the effects of global warming on the human race. This piece consists of a large room resembling a dry desert environment. In the center of the room, an ice sculpture of a man working on a computer sits on display. Over time, the ice slowly melts away onto the ground, symbolizing how the depletion of time for humans to reverse global warming could lead to our eventual extinction.  I chose to create a conceptual spatial art piece because I felt that placing a physical and large installation in front of potential viewers is the best way to represent how ‘large’ and ‘in your face’ this issue really is. Although many people choose to ignore the problem that is right in front of them, sometimes it needs to be confronted and viewed right up close in order to truly understand. Creating the conceptual image of this installation made me more comfortable using Photoshop than ever before, and I feel more confident as my skills in this medium continue to grow.

     This piece was created for an Adobe Illustrator class at Las Positas Community College. The purpose was to practice and become more comfortable with the digital platform, and the prompt was 'cult leaders'. I created this piece on the famous cult leader Marshall Applewhite, who is commonly associated with his strong universal faith, and his belief in UFOs. I utilized Illustrator's pen tool and challenged my own creativity to produce an imaginative depiction of Applewhite, that perfectly encapsulated who he was and what he was known for. By this time, I was already fairly comfortable with my using this platform, but producing this art piece made me more proud of how my skills and confidence were advancing.

     <b>Project Description:</b>
     <br>
       This piece was an assignment created for a color theory course at Las Positas Community College. Produced digitally on ProCreate, I wanted to experiment with the concept of mortality, and depict life and death through plant cycles. On the left, we see a shriveled, darker-colored plant appearing to be on the brink of dying, contrasted to the brighter-colored plant on the right, which is at the beginning of its life cycle, still growing in its glass enclosure. While these two plants are meant to show the contrast between life and death next to one another, they are also meant to suggest how one state of life can contribute to the other, and how they can go hand in hand. For the background, I wanted to create a somber but peaceful scene to tie into my concept, filled with muted, cool-toned colors, and foggy skies. This also suggests the beautiness and serenity that life can be, even in death. By choosing to focus on plants in order to convey the concept of mortality, I aimed to highlight the quiet durability and inescapable transformation of nature, and how it connects us as humans to all living things.
